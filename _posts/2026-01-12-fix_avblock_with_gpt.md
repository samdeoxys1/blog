"Broken" is probably too strong a word to describe my first degree AV block. And GPT probably didn’t fix it in the clinical sense — I still have the AV block, and doctors don’t really have a treatment for it (other than pacemaker when things get really bad). But it did relieve the tightness/pain in my chest that used to hit every time I tried to fall asleep, something doctors mostly shrugged off. This process reinforced my belief about how people could take care of themselves beyond medicines or even traditional, generic health advices.

# What is AV block (skip if not interested in how the body works)?
Your heart is powered by electricity.
- The SA node (sinoatrial node) is the built-in pacemaker. It fires an electrical impulse.
- That signal spreads across the atria (upper chambers), making them contract and push blood into the ventricles (lower chambers).
- Between them sits the AV node (atrioventricular node), a checkpoint that delays the signal slightly so the ventricles have time to fill.
- In AV block, that delay becomes longer than normal. In severe cases, impulses don’t make it through and the ventricles can skip beats.
Most first-degree AV block is considered benign. But “benign on paper” can still feel terrible in a living body.


# My symptoms
I discovered the AV block by accident during an EKG for surgery. For years, I felt nothing. However, over the years (when I was past 25), I developed occasional chest pain and tightness. It felt like something deep under my left rib cages was sore and clenched, but untouchable. It escalated from “occasionally when I stayed up late” to “almost every night before bed” to “sometimes even during the day”. The worst part was the sleep loop: pain kept me awake; staying awake amplified the pain. 

# What the doctors old me (and why it didn’t help)
I did all the tests the cardiologist recommended. Nothing alarming (maybe relative to people closer to death). The cardiologist kept reassuring me that first degree AV block is a common situation, and no research clearly links it to my chest pain (as I will emphasize again later, this is a dangerous style of reasoning when it comes to health), and that it could simply come from stress (an easy scapegoat!). The only thing to do is to monitor it and get a pacemaker if things get worse. These words were meant to be reassuring, but it only added to my disappointment and distrust.

# Alternative routes
While I tend to casually accuse Western medicine of “not doing XXX”, today so many Eastern/traditional health practices have already been incorporated into Western culture, such that doctors would readily recommend these practices while prescribing pills. I’m an avid meditator and also practice yoga among other exercises. The cardiologist said all these are good, and my meditation should actually help the pain because it reduces stress. However my experience was that the pain was worse during meditation. Traditional yoga poses that claim to be good for the heart (according to YouTube, e.g. chest opening moves), also didn’t offer much relief. I also thought breathing might help with blood flow. But the prevalent advice of “slow down your breathe” actually makes the pain worse (my breathing is already quite slow).

# Wrangling with ChatGPT
The fix came from when I asked ChatGPT how I could keep meditating given the chest pain. Initially, ChatGPT was repeating the same platitude as the cardiologist — AV block usually is fine; when it’s serious you need a pacemaker; keep monitoring. I therefore asked ChatGPT to reason from first principle, and reiterate that my pain only happened at times when the heart rate gets lower (sleep and meditation). ChatGPT finally pointed out it could be a state-dependent reduction in cardiac output, i.e. during a low arousal state, the heart rate gets lower, and thus the total blood output becomes not enough. This is probably why a lot of traditionally healthy practices (meditation, slow breathing, etc.), aiming at lowering the heart rate, didn’t help much and might even backfire.

# The surprising fix: calves 
My first instinct was: “Okay, then I should raise my heart rate.” But exercise only helps temporarily; sleep still brings everything back down. And intentionally breathing fast to keep heart rate up sounded… not great.

Then GPT pointed out a lever I hadn’t considered:
***increase venous return.***

Here’s the idea: when blood returns from the legs, it’s fighting gravity with relatively low pressure. Your calf muscles act like a second pump. When calves contract, they squeeze deep veins, and one-way valves prevent backflow—so each squeeze pushes blood upward toward the heart.
Any doctor would know this basic physiology. But GPT was the one that connected it to my situation and proposed it as a practical intervention.

So I tried it. When I lie down and feel that familiar tightness, I rhythmically squeeze and release my calves for a minute or two.

The effect felt absurdly direct—like I had found a manual override. After a few minutes, something “catches,” and I don’t need to keep doing it. I fall asleep without pain and wake up actually rested.
There’s probably a dynamical-systems story here: a small, targeted push nudges the body into a different stable regime. I’ll save that for another post.


# Final rants: what this taught me about health reasoning
## “No studies show a link” is not the same as “no link exists”
Doctors often reason like this:
There’s no evidence from clinical research connecting X and Y, therefore Y is probably not caused by X.
That’s understandable, but dangerous as a habit. Research is constrained by what people decide to study, what gets funded, what’s easy to measure, and what counts as “important enough.” Absence of evidence can mean many things besides “false.”

For messy and individual problems, starting from mechanism can be more informative than starting from the literature.

## Alternatives to “symptom-first, escalation-later” treatment. 
In my experience dealing with various ailments, doctors’ strategy often boil down to: treat symptoms (antacid, painkiller, etc.) or monitor until it gets “bad enough”, then intervene surgically.
But many in-between states might respond to personalized adjustments based on physiology and feeling — specific movements, posture, heat, nutrition, supplements, and so on. Not every personalized adjustments have clean randomized controlled trial evidence, as it can be hard to study. That doesn’t make the adjustments useless, but just mean one has to experiment on oneself and reflect on the results in a careful and honest way (within a safe range of course).   

## Binary labeling (“healthy” vs “unhealthy”) is a trap
Kale is “superfood”, until your stomach is inflamed. Slow breathing is the “correct” breathing, until your baseline is already slow and slowing further makes you feel worse. Meditation is healthy, until it triggers my chest pain. The health industry — commercials, books and podcasts love feeding people with oversimplified panecea. The lost philosophy is contextualism: good-for-what, good-for-whom, good-under-which-conditions.

## Combing the third-person and first-person view is the solution
Skepticism toward subjective reports in both psychology and medicine, was once a breakthrough, but it’s started to look like throwing the baby out with the bathwater. What helped me this time was the combination of a third-person mechanistic understanding (how circulation Works) and first-person data (what my body reliably does in specific states). 

## AI in the loop
AI did not work in my first try. But once it’s integrated into a first-person-third-person loop, it was powerful enough to solve my problem. It was helpful in connecting my first-person experience to relevant third-person mechanisms, and searching for the intervention. My first-person intuition was again needed to realize what aspects of my experience was relevant for the AI. It was also needed to calibrate a general instruction (like calf squeeze) into specific executional details (squeeze for how long, rest for how long, total for how long, etc.).

It’s a path full of pitfalls, which is exactly why we should get better at it, not dismiss it.
